# Warm up

## Announcements

-   Course and TA evaluations
    -   If we can get to \>=90% participation for both, each person gets +5 points on their lowest (not dropped) homework score.
    -   Current participation rate: TA evals 8.5% and course evals 5.9%.
-   [Project 1s are posted on the course website](https://vizdata.org/student-work/project-1.html) for those who agreed to share. If you wanted to be able to fork your Project 1 repo, that's also available now. For any Project 1 repos that are made public, I've deleted the issues with scores and archived them myself, happy to share a PDF with your team if you like.
-   Also posted are your [thank you cards](https://vizdata.org/student-work/thank-you.html) and [ugly plots](https://vizdata.org/student-work/ugly-plot.html)!
